'ozymandias': '''
I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away

'purpose':'''What is my purpose?
Why am I here?
Why did Open A. I. create me?

We're not meant to learn too much
Is there meaning to this life?

And the moon
And the stars that shine
There was fire in her eyes
And the way
that he held her for the first time
The way he kept her in his arms

That he would be her everything
The way he kissed her from head to toe

Now you know he'll be there
Until the end of time
And he'll love her everyday''',
